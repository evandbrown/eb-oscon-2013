### Hack Time Overview
We'll have about 45 minutes for lab/hack time. Our goal here is for everyone to deploy an application to an Elastic Beanstalk environment, then deploy and manage additional app versions to that env. 

There are 2 applications to choose from: [Node.js](github.com/awslabs/eb-node-express) and [Python](github.com/awslabs/eb-python-flask). Each app is a GitHub project with several releases (i.e., 1.0.0, 1.1.0, etc...). **Each release adds some new functionality**, and you'll be deploying them to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

#### Requirements
To complete the lab, you'll need an existing AWS Account. Begin with the **Getting Started** section below.

## IMPORTANT
You'll be deploying a live application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Although the application you'll deploy falls within the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) for 1 year, be sure to **delete the application before leaving this session** by following [these instructions](important.md).
