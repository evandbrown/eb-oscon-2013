Project Name: AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Zero to Cloud in Sixty Minutes
Tagline: OSCON 2013 Birds of a Feather Session

### Welcome to the Session

In this repository you'll find links to the slide deck and labs used in the OSCON 2013 Birds of a Feather session "AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Zero to Cloud in Sixty Minutes" presented by AWS Community Manager Evan Brown (@evandbrown).

### Slides
Sort-of. The Prezi used in this session can be found at [insert link here](insert link here). We'll spend about 15 minutes covering the fundamentals of AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

There are 4 applications to choose from: [Python](github.com/awslabs/eb-python-flask), [Node.js](github.com/awslabs/eb-node-express), [PHP](github.com/awslabs/eb-php-symfony), and [Ruby](github.com/awslabs/eb-ruby-rails). Each app is a GitHub project with several releases (i.e., 1.0.0, 1.1.0, etc...), where each release adds some new functionality (that's what releases are all about, right?)
